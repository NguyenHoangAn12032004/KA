## 🚀 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Backup Current Database

```bash
# Create backup before migration
cd backend
node migrate.js backup
```

### Step 2: Create Migration Files

```bash
# Generate all phase migration files
node migrate.js create-files
```

### Step 3: Run Database Migration

Choose one of these approaches:

#### Option A: All Phases at Once (Recommended for development)
```bash
# Run complete migration
node migrate.js run
```

#### Option B: Phase by Phase (Recommended for production)
```bash
# Run each phase individually
node migrate.js run 1  # Core schema updates
node migrate.js run 2  # New tables
node migrate.js run 3  # Indexes and constraints
node migrate.js run 4  # Triggers and functions
node migrate.js run 5  # Initial data
```

### Step 4: Update Prisma Schema

```bash
# Update schema.prisma and generate client
node update-schema.js update
```

### Step 5: Install Dependencies (if needed)

```bash
npm install @prisma/client
npm install prisma --save-dev
```

### Step 6: Restart Application

```bash
# Restart your application to use new schema
npm run dev
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Migration Fails**
```bash
# Check logs
cat migration.log

# Restore backup
psql "DATABASE_URL" < backup_file.sql
```

**Prisma Client Errors**
```bash
# Regenerate client
npx prisma generate

# Reset database (development only)
npx prisma migrate reset
```

**Performance Issues**
```sql
-- Check slow queries
SELECT query, mean_time 
FROM pg_stat_statements 
ORDER BY mean_time DESC 
LIMIT 10;

-- Analyze table statistics
ANALYZE;
```

### Support

For issues during implementation:
1. Check migration logs in `migration.log`
2. Verify database backup exists
3. Test on development environment first
4. Review Prisma client generation
5. Validate API endpoint responses
